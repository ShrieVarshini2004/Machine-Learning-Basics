KNN basics:
1. Dataset Exploration 🔍📊
Let’s dive into your dataset! The df.head() command gives us a quick look at the first few rows. Each row represents a customer, and the columns capture cool details like region, age, income, and more.

💡 Spotlight on the Target:
The custcat column is the target variable—aka the customer category. Categories include 1, 2, 3, and 4.

👥 Customer Count by Category:

Category 4: 281 customers
Category 1: 266 customers
Others? Slightly fewer, but they’re still important!

2. Income Distribution 💵📈
🎨 A histogram shows how customer incomes are spread out:

Are incomes bunched together or spread all over?
Any wild outliers?
Is it skewed to the left, right, or nicely balanced?
This visual helps uncover patterns in customer earnings—great for spotting trends! 📊✨

3. Dataset Split Info ✂️📦
Your data was split into training and test sets, with 80% used for training the model and 20% for testing.

Training data: 800 customers, 11 features.
Test data: 200 customers, ready to challenge the model!

4. Model Training 🤖📚
You trained a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier! 🏋️‍♀️ The model studied the training data to learn how to categorize customers based on their features. 🎉

5. Predictions 🔮📤
The model made its predictions on the test data, like:
Category 1, Category 4, Category 3, and so on. Each number reflects what the model thinks about a specific customer—how cool is that? 😎

6. Accuracy Scores 🎯📊
📈 Here’s how the model performed:

Training Accuracy: 54.75%
Test Accuracy: 32%
Uh-oh! The test accuracy is much lower than the training accuracy. This suggests the model might be overfitting—memorizing the training data instead of learning to generalize. 😬

🛠 Insights & Fix-It Ideas 🧰
Let’s turn this around:

Tune k 🧮: Try different numbers of neighbors (k) to find the best fit!
For that we have implimented another code that visually plots all the testing accuracies for k values till 10 from which we found out that k=9 is the best k value.
Feature Engineering 🛠️: Add or remove features to sharpen the model’s skills.
Cross-Validation 🌀: Use techniques like k-fold validation for a clearer performance picture.
Experiment with Models 🧠: KNN is great, but maybe decision trees 🌳, logistic regression ➗, or even random forests 🌲 will work better here.
